<h1>About Me</h1>

<body>
  <main>
    <p>
      Heyo! My name is Daniel Ni. Currently a full time student at
      <a href="https://www.senecacollege.ca/home.html" target="_blank">Seneca College</a>.<br />
      <br />
      This website is my submission for my final project for WEB222, where I am to design
      a webpage <em>supposedly</em>
      to impress a client or something. I'm mostly just going to use this as a space to place all my silly ideas.<br>
      <br>
      <em>Hey daniel, isn't this page kinda similar to <b>a dark room</b>? the hit browser and mobile game made in
        html?</em><br>
      I won't lie, it just ocurred to me while programming this webzone that it's vaguely inspired. But i swear i was
      subliminally influenced or something (i did play that game a lot in elementary school).
